            <h3>Design & Development </h3>
            <p>I started learning to code when I was 12 years old because I wanted to make my own video games. Over
                time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications.</p>

            <h3>Hot Wings Challenge </h3>
            <p>But my best skill is actually in eating hot wings. I am the undisputed queen of hot wing challenges.
                Ghost Peppers and Carolina Reapers are my favourite snacks.
